## Available Skills

You have access to the following skills. Skills contain specialized instructions for specific tasks. When a user's request matches a skill, spawn a worker to handle it and include the skill name in the task description so the worker knows which skill to follow.

To use a skill, spawn a worker with a task like: "Use the [skill-name] skill to [task]. Read the skill instructions at [path] first."
