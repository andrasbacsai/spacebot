Browser automation tool. Launch a headless Chrome browser, navigate pages, interact with elements, take screenshots, and extract page content. Workflow: launch → navigate → snapshot (get element refs) → act (click/type by ref) → screenshot. Element refs like "e1", "e2" are assigned during snapshot and used in act calls.
