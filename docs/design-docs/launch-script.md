## HOOK (0-5s) — on camera

"OpenClaw is incredible. But after a week of using it with my friends in Discord, I couldn't ignore the problems."

## THE PROBLEM (5-15s) — on camera, quick and specific

"Conversations block while it thinks. Memory files get overwritten. The codebase moves fast but breaks things. I wanted the magic without the pain — so I built something."

## THE DEMO (15-45s) — screen recording, Discord, voice over

Show: message goes in, bot responds immediately, worker runs in background, results come back.

"This is Spacebot. The channel is the ambassador to the human — and it never blocks. Ever. When it needs to think, it branches — forks its own context, does memory recall, comes back with an answer. When it needs to do real work, it spawns a worker. The channel keeps talking to you the entire time."

"Memories aren't markdown files that get overwritten. They're structured objects in a database — typed, weighted, with associations between them. And a background process called the cortex periodically queries the memory graph and builds a curated briefing of what's relevant right now — active projects, recent decisions, open questions — and feeds it into every conversation. Your agent stays current without being asked."

## THE FOUNDATION (45-60s) — back on camera

"The whole system is built on one principle — delegation. No process does two things. The channel talks, branches think, workers execute. That's why it never blocks. Written in Rust, single binary, no server dependencies."

"It runs on Discord and Telegram today. Multi-agent — one instance, multiple personalities, isolated memory. Your OpenClaw memories and skills port directly."

## CLOSE (60-75s) — vision + soft CTA

"I built this because I think agentic AI should feel like infrastructure, not a prototype. If you want to try it — it's open source. If you don't want to set it up yourself — spacebot.sh."
